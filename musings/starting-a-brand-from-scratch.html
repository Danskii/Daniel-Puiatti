            <h2>Starting a brand from scratch</h2>
            <p><small class="text-muted">Starting a brand from scratch takes grit. Starting a brand from scratch is no joke.</small></p>
            <p>At some point in December 2017 I decided I would try and sell products online. Real original, I know.</p>
            <p>I think the idea took hold when I came across a Shopify advertisement promoting something called drop shipping as a way to generate income through ecommerce. The idea Shopify advertised was seductively simple:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>start up a trial ecommerce store with Shopify.</li>
                <li>connect your ecommerce store to an automated drop shipping product (Oberlo)</li>
                <li>run some ads to drive traffic to your store and watch the money roll in.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Some money did roll in, but it was far less than was rolling out. I had no financial success with Shopify or Oberlo, but failure imparts it's own value: wisdom. I had attempted to break into a market which was over-saturated with bigger and better product providers. Competing with the likes of Amazon and Ali Express provided too monumental a task.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I was optimistic that I might still be able to develop a profitable ecommerce business. So I started to consider some alternative products and approaches: baby product reviews, pet food newsletters, trading cards forums, you name it. Almost every niche product has a market, and a blog trying to sell you on monetizing it. However, with so many providers offering the same product I would need to rely on a different value proposition. Instead of better prices, faster shipping or sophisticated ecommerce system, I would need to develop a following of people who liked the idea of my business. I would need to develop a brand. So...</p>

                    <p>I spent some time applying my design skills towards building out a simple tshirt brand.</p>
                    <p>I built a website from scratch to accompany this brand: <a href="http://danskii.com/" target="_blank">Danskii.com</a></p>
                    <p>I integrated analytics, marketing and and business intelligence tools:</p>
                    <ul>
                         <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/"><li>Google Analytics</li></a>
                        <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/"><li>HotJar</li></a>
                        <a href="https://mailchimp.com/"><li>MailChimp</li></a>
                    </ul>
                    <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ddaannskii/" target="_blank">I set up the social media profiles.</a></p>
                    <p>Then, I rested. But not for long! This was only the first step. Now I need followers.</p>
