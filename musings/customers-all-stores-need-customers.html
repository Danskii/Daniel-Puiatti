Alright, so I had the brand, the product and the website all ready to go, fancy tracking codes installed with analytics and A/B testing technology and newsletter signup form. Lovely I know. But I needed customers.

Customers do not manifest from the ether
This is where a stark realization took hold. All the time and effort I invested in building the aformationed product and website were meaningless unless I had customers.

Now, marketing. Now, advertising
Thus I began building customers. I decided I would, once a week, produce enough visual content featuring my brand so that I could publish a post on social daily.

Every Monday I sit down for an hour, source images, photoshop my logo onto them, schedule and publish content. I have been doing this for nearly two months now. Traffic is increasing minimally.

I decided I would suppliment this organic content with an advertising campaign. SO I build a funnel. I built some ads, I targeted some audiences and I let the campaign run. I optimized, refined and optimzied more, tested new creative, new copy. I let the campaign run.

Every day, slowly, more impressions, more awareness. Every week I spend another few hours creating organic content.

So far, one tshirt. That's all I sold. No one said building a brand from scratch would be easy.
