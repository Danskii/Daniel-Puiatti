<h2>Starting a brand from scratch</h2>
<small class ="text-muted">Starting a brand from scratch takes grit, persistance and flexibility. Starting a brand from scratch is no joke.</small>
<p>At some point in December 2017 I decided I would try and sell products online. Real original, I know.</p> 
<p>I think the idea took hold when I came across a Shopify advertisement promoting something called drop shipping as a way to generate income through ecommerce. The concept was seductively simple. Start up a trial ecommerce store with Shopify, connect your ecommerce store to an additional product called Oberlo, run some ads to drive traffic to your store and watch the money roll in.</p>
<p>Well, some money rolled in, but it was far less than was was rolling out. I had no success with Shopify or Oberlo. However, the notion that I could make this ecommerce thing work persisted in my mind. I felt determined.</p>
<p>Armed with the bitter sweet knowledge which falure so harshly imparts on  memory, I started to consider the alternatives. And alternatives there were: baby products, pet food, trading cards, you name it. Almost every niche product has a market, and a blog trying to sell you on selling it.</p>
<p>Tshirts called out to me. I thought, OK I have some basic design skills, perhaps I can apply them. So I did. 
<p>Inspired by my failed cat themed ecommerce Shopify store I decided I would take the name and logo from the store and sell tshirts with it. I imagined hundreds of variants of the logo: city themes, sports themes, pirate themes, and on and on. But I started with one.</p>
<img src="" alt="Danskii logo and brand">
<p>I spent some time applying my web development skills towards building out a <a href="http://danskii.com">website for the brand</a>. Eventually I came up with something simple. I connected this brand page to a tshirt printing and fulfillment website called Teespring and on the seventh day I rested.</p>
<p>Alright, so I had the brand, the product and the website all ready to go, fancy tracking codes installed with analytics and A/B testing technology and newsletter signup form. Lovely I know. But I needed customers. </p>
<h3>Customers do not manifest from the ether</h3>
<p>This is where a stark realization took hold. All the time and effort I invested in building the aformationed product and website were meaningless unless I had customers.</p>
<h3>Now, marketing. Now, advertising</h3>
<p>Thus I began building customers. I decided I would, once a week, produce enough visual content featuring my brand so that I could publish a post on social daily.</p>
<p>Every Monday I sit down for an hour, source images, photoshop my logo onto them, schedule and publish content. I have been doing this for nearly two months now. Traffic is increasing minimally.</p>
<p>I decided I would suppliment this organic content with an advertising campaign. SO I build a funnel. I built some ads, I targeted some audiences and I let the campaign run. I optimized, refined and optimzied more, tested new creative, new copy. I let the campaign run.</p>
<p>Every day, slowly, more impressions, more awareness. Every week I spend another few hours creating organic content.</p>

<p>So far, one tshirt. That's all I sold. No one said building a brand from scratch would be easy.</p>
